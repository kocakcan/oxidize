/// Smart Pointers
///
/// A pointer is a general concept for a variable that contains an address in memory. This address
/// refers to, or "points at," some other data. The most common kind of pointer in Rust is a
/// reference. References are indicated by the & symbol and borrow the value they point to. They
/// don't have any special capabilities other than referring to data, and they have no overhead.
///
/// Smart pointers, on the other hand, are data structures that act like a pointer but also have
/// additional metadata and capabilities. Rust has a variety of smart pointers defined in the
/// standard library that provide functionality beyond that provided by references.
///
/// In Rust, with its concept of ownership and borrowing, there is an additional difference between
/// references and smart pointers: While references only borrow data, in many cases smart pointers
/// own the data they point to.
///
/// Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs. Unlike an ordinary struct, smart pointers
/// implement the Deref and Drop traits. The Deref trait allows an instance of the smart pointer
/// struct to behave like a reference so that you can write your code to work with either
/// references or smart pointers. The Drop trait allows you to customize the code that's run when
/// an instance of the smart pointer goes out of scope.
///
///     - Box<T>, for allocating values on the heap
///     - Rc<T>, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership
///     - Ref<T> and RefMut<T>, accessed through RefCell<T>, a type that enforces the borrowing
///     rules at runtime instead of compile time
///
/// Using Box<T> to Point to Data on the Heap
///
/// The most straightforward smart pointer is a box, whose type is written Box<T>. Boxes allow you
/// to store data on the heap rather than the stack. What remains on the stack is the pointer to
/// the heap data.
///
/// Boxes don't have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the heap instead of on
/// the stack. But they don't have many extra capabilities either. You'll use the most often in
/// these situations:
///
///     - When you have a type whose size can't be known at compile time, and you want to use a
///     value of that type in a context that requires an exact size
///     - When you have a large amount of data, and you want to transfer ownership but ensure that
///     the data won't be copied when you do so
///     - When you want to own a value, and you care only that it's a type that implements a
///     particular trait rather than being of a specific type
///
/// Storing Data on the Heap
///
///     fn main() {
///         let b = Box::new(5);
///         println!("b = {b}");
///     }
///     Listing 15-1: Storing an i32 value on the heap using a box
/// We define the variable b to have the value of a Box that points to the value 5, which is
/// allocated on the heap. This program will print b = 5; in this case, we can access the data in
/// the box similarly to how we would if this data were on the stack. Just like any owned value,
/// when a box goes out of scope, as b does at the end of main, it will be deallocated. The
/// deallocation happens both for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to (stored
/// on the heap).
///
/// Putting a single value on the heap isn't very useful, so you won't use boxes by themselves in
/// this way very often. Having values like a single i32 on the stack, where they're stored by
/// default, is more appropriate in the majority of situations.
